      <p>Just a few years ago, Iris Gillian could not have pictured herself where she is today. In 2012, she graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law prepared to commit herself to a career championing workers’ rights as a labor and employment
        attorney.
        <br> <br> But this year, the mother of two resigned from her position as Assistant General Counsel for a labor union in Washington D.C. to stay home and raise her children. <br> <br> “I had a really good job but didn’t have the flexibility I wanted
        as a new mom to work from home some days or even take a smaller role like working 3 days a week,” said Gillian. “I look at Canada where it could be possible to take up to a year of leave and maybe I would still be working if that was our reality
        in the U.S.” <br> <br> Iris Gillian is part of a shrinking demographic across the United States: the percentage of working age women who either work or want to work. The <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/es_10192017_decline_womens_labor_force_participation_blackschanzenbach.pdf">decline in women’s labor force
        participation </a> comes at a noteworthy period when unemployment has hit a record low and employers are faced with worker shortages. The number of job openings in the US is soaring, and individuals with advanced degrees, like Gillian, would be considered highly
        sought after for skilled jobs.

        <p> Some economists suggest that during a thriving economy, couples with higher incomes may be less incentivized to have both spouses in the workforce. <br> <br> “We see more women dropping out of the labor force who have higher incomes than women
          with lower incomes, it may be because they have husbands with comparable incomes who can support the family through a period of maternity leave,” said Danielle Sandler, Senior Economist at the U.S. Census Bureau. “That would also be true in
          a booming economy, if a husband is doing better it gives more opportunity for the wife to take a longer leave.” <br> <br> Over the past half century, American women have made substantial <a href="https://www.dol.gov/wb/stats/NEWSTATS/facts.htm">progress</a> in the labor market. Most visibly, the growth
          of women’s labor force participation since the mid 20th century increased dramatically from 37 percent in 1962 to 61 percent in 2000. This increase in women’s labor force participation was enough to offset the declining labor force participation
          of men which had been steadily falling for more than 60 years. The US was at a moment in time a leader in women working. In 1985, America was second only to Sweden in the proportion of prime-age women with jobs or actively seeking paid employment.
          <br> <br> But in 2000, this growth stagnated – a pattern constant across women of varying races, ethnicities, educational backgrounds, ages, and marital statuses, and for women with and without children alike. <br> <br>

          The sluggish participation rate is particularly affecting women who would be expected to be the most attached to the labor market: college educated women. Similarly, these women are more likely to be married than ever before at a time when the education
          gap in marital status has continued to widen. In 2015, among adults ages 25 and older, 65% with a four-year college degree were married compared to 55% of those with some college education and 50% among those with no education beyond high school.
          Just twenty years ago, the rate lingered above 60% for all groups. <br><br> As the US economy continues to grow, economists point to prospective wage growth and expanded benefits by employers in the near term that may encourage pools
          of applicants who have voluntarily stayed out of the labor force. The reality of prolonged labor shortages could trigger companies to act by offering benefits that may be supportive of working mothers such as flexibility and teleworking options.
          <br><br> “For employers trying to fill specific high skill positions, the labor could come from prime working age women” said Michael Gapen, Chief US Economist, Barclays. “Traditionally these women may be out of the workforce taking care of
          children but the economy is good and there may be more lucrative job offers in the future that could bring them back”.<br><br>
